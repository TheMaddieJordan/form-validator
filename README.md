This Form Validator is my first full JavaScript project in over a year!

I got out of coding as my focus for work shifted to WordPress design. I am now out of that particular field, so I wanted to put my time back into code!

This is a simple form validator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am going through a Brad Traversy Javascript course to refresh my memory, and I am adding and customizing features as I go. I know these smaller projects will help me get back into it by focusing on the basics for a little bit.
